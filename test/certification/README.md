# CAPHV Certification Suites

This directory contains the certification suites for CAPHV (Cluster API Provider
Harvester). They validate that a CAPHV release installs cleanly and stays compatible
with its targeted ecosystem, in two tiers — neither needs a Harvester endpoint, so both
run on standard CI runners:

| Tier | Suite | Stack | Trigger |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **Turtles integration** (the suite the Turtles team expects) | `suites/import-gitops/` | Full Rancher + Turtles + real Harvester: `CreateUsingGitOpsSpec` provisions a cluster, verifies Available, the Rancher auto-import (cattle-cluster-agent) and a clean deletion | self-hosted runner (needs a Harvester) |
| **Version-pairing** (nightly) | `suites/version-pairing/` | CAPI core + RKE2 via [cluster-api-operator] — no Rancher | `certification.yml` (nightly + dispatch) |
| **Rancher + Turtles stack** (on-demand) | `suites/rancher-turtles/` | Full released Rancher; Turtles/CAPI/RKE2 via its system chart controller — no workload cluster | `certification-tier-a.yml` (dispatch) |

> Terminology: Turtles has no provider *certification* process — "certified" means
> "actively tested". The integration tier is the flow the Turtles team maintains in
> [rancher/turtles-integration-suite-example]; the other two tiers are lighter
> complements. Version pairings are recorded in [docs/compatibility.md](../../docs/compatibility.md).

> Why is the nightly tier Rancher-free? Turtles 0.26+ cannot run standalone: its
> controller watches Rancher's `management.cattle.io` CRDs and crashloops without a full
> Rancher install. The nightly tier therefore certifies the deeper CAPHV↔CAPI contract
> through the Rancher-independent cluster-api-operator, and the full-stack tier covers
> the Rancher integration on demand. The deeper e2e (real Harvester provisioning +
> auto-import) remains separate; the
> `suites/data/cluster-templates/harvester-rke2-topology.yaml` template is retained
> for it.

## Tier: version-pairing (nightly)

The suite self-deploys a kind management cluster with cert-manager and
cluster-api-operator, then installs the CAPI core, the RKE2 bootstrap/control-plane
providers and the CAPHV release under test, and asserts the pairing is healthy.

### What the suite validates

1. The four providers (CAPI core, RKE2 bootstrap, RKE2 control-plane, CAPHV
   infrastructure) all reach `Ready=True`, with the targeted versions installed.
2. The `caphv-controller-manager` deployment becomes Available under the targeted CAPI
   core.
3. The CAPHV CRDs are registered and advertise a `cluster.x-k8s.io/<contract>` label the
   core accepts.

The bootstrap replicates `hack/tier-c-smoke.sh` — the manually validated recipe — step by
step. If you change one, keep the other in sync.

## Tier: Rancher + Turtles (on-demand)

`suites/rancher-turtles/` certifies CAPHV under the FULL targeted Rancher: kind +
cert-manager + nginx ingress (isolated mode), then the **released Rancher** from its
official chart repository. Rancher's system chart controller automatically installs the
released Turtles, the CAPI core and the RKE2 providers — the exact out-of-the-box stack
a Rancher user gets (verified against a real Rancher 2.14.1 install). Only the CAPHV
`CAPIProvider` (`turtles-capi.cattle.io/v1alpha1`) is applied on top.

It validates: the CAPHV CAPIProvider reaches `Ready` with the targeted version, the
controller runs healthy under the Rancher-managed core, the CRDs carry a CAPI contract
label, and the certified ecosystem versions (Turtles system chart, CAPI core) are
recorded in the logs.

> The upstream Turtles e2e flow additionally builds a local rancher/charts tree and
> serves it from an in-cluster Gitea — that is only needed to test **unreleased**
> Turtles charts. Certifying released pairings uses Rancher's default chart repository,
> which is the representative source, so no Gitea is involved.

Run with `make test-tier-a` (or `make certification-test-tier-a` from the project root),
overriding `RANCHER_VERSION` / `CAPHV_VERSION` as needed. Budget ~30-45 minutes.

## Tier: Turtles integration suite (primary, scheduled)

`suites/import-gitops/` runs the Turtles `CreateUsingGitOpsSpec` — the suite the
Turtles team runs for every certified provider (modeled on
`rancher/turtles-integration-suite-example`) — against a **real Harvester**:

1. kind + cert-manager + nginx (hostPort) + released Rancher + Turtles + CAPI core,
   plus the RKE2 providers and the CAPHV `CAPIProvider`;
2. a ClusterClass-based RKE2 cluster (1 CP + 1 worker) is provisioned on Harvester
   through GitOps (Fleet), with a pool-backed control-plane LoadBalancer;
3. the cluster becomes `Available`, Rancher auto-imports it (cattle-cluster-agent
   deployed downstream and connected), the v3 cluster record turns ready;
4. the CAPI cluster is deleted and the suite verifies the deletion completes and the
   Rancher record disappears (no stalling finalizers, VMs/LB/IPs released).

**Environment requirements** (see also the workflow
`.github/workflows/certification-import-gitops.yml`): a Linux host with **docker**
(kind's mainstream provider), `kind`, `helm`, `kubectl`, `go` and the `crust-gather`
kubectl plugin (`scripts/ensure-crust-gather.sh`), plus two network properties:

- `RANCHER_HOSTNAME` (e.g. `<host-LAN-IP>.sslip.io`) must be reachable on 443 both
  from inside the kind cluster and **from the workload VMs** Harvester provisions;
- the host must reach the Harvester API and the workload cluster's control-plane
  endpoint (an IP from the Harvester LB pool).

A plain VM on the LAN satisfies both. Rootless/NAT'd container engines on multi-bridge
hosts often do not — nested kind networking is the first thing to check when the
downstream agent cannot reach the server-url.

In CI the suite runs on a **self-hosted runner** living inside the test environment
(same pattern as the Turtles vSphere runner), on a schedule and manual dispatch only —
never on pull requests. `HARVESTER_KUBECONFIG_B64` is provided as an Actions secret.

Run manually with `MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=internal-kind`,
`RANCHER_HOSTNAME=<host-ip>.sslip.io` and `HARVESTER_KUBECONFIG_B64=$(base64 -w0 <
kubeconfig)`; budget ~40 minutes (see the workflow for the full invocation).

## Version matrix

All pins live in `config/config.yaml` (`variables:`) and are overridable from the
environment:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CAPHV_VERSION` | `v0.3.1` | CAPHV release under certification |
| `CAPHV_COMPONENTS_URL` | release asset URL | `infrastructure-components.yaml` of that release |
| `CAPI_VERSION` | `v1.12.7` | Targeted Cluster API core (version-pairing tier) |
| `CAPI_OPERATOR_VERSION` | `0.27.0` | cluster-api-operator helm chart (version-pairing tier) |
| `RANCHER_VERSION` | `2.14.1` | Targeted Rancher chart (Rancher+Turtles tier) |

The RKE2 providers deliberately carry no pin: the operator installs its latest known
release, matching the validated recipe. cert-manager's version is pinned by the turtles
`DeployCertManager` helper.

## Prerequisites

- A container runtime for kind: docker, or **rootful** podman (the kind library
  auto-detects docker → nerdctl → podman; the CLI-only `KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER`
  variable has no effect here). No kind binary is needed — kind is vendored as a Go
  library.
- `helm` (v3+) and `kubectl` on `PATH`.
- Go (version per `go.mod`).
- Internet access (chart repos, GitHub release assets, ghcr.io).

## Running

```bash
# Wrapper script (resolves helm path, creates artifacts folder)
./run.sh

# Keep the kind cluster for debugging
./run.sh --skip-cleanup

# Or via make (same defaults)
make test

# Certify a different pairing
CAPHV_VERSION=v0.3.2 \
CAPHV_COMPONENTS_URL=https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/cluster-api-provider-harvester/releases/download/v0.3.2/infrastructure-components.yaml \
./run.sh
```

From the project root: `make certification-test` / `make certification-build`.

On a podman host, build first and run the compiled binary as root (kind needs rootful
podman, and this keeps Go caches owned by your user):

```bash
make build
sudo -E env "PATH=$PATH" HOME=/root \
  E2E_CONFIG=$PWD/config/config.yaml ARTIFACTS_FOLDER=$PWD/_artifacts \
  HELM_BINARY_PATH=$(command -v helm) \
  ./bin/certification.test -test.timeout 60m -ginkgo.v -ginkgo.label-filter=short
```

## Certification submission

After the suite passes for a new pairing, a certification issue can be submitted on
[rancher/turtles](https://github.com/rancher/turtles/issues) with the test logs, the
CAPHV version and a link to this suite.

## Tier: Turtles integration (import-gitops)

Runs `CreateUsingGitOpsSpec` against a **real Harvester**: kind management cluster with
host port mappings (`MANAGEMENT_CLUSTER_ENVIRONMENT=internal-kind`), full Rancher from
its official chart, Turtles + CAPI core via Rancher's system chart controller, RKE2 and
CAPHV as `CAPIProvider`s, then the full lifecycle: provision from the ClusterClass
template → cluster Available → Rancher auto-import verified downstream → deletion
without stalling.

Environment-specific inputs (never committed): `RANCHER_HOSTNAME` must resolve to a
host IP reachable **from the workload VMs** (e.g. `<host-lan-ip>.sslip.io`, ports 80/443
open), and `HARVESTER_KUBECONFIG_B64`. Install crust-gather first
(`scripts/ensure-crust-gather.sh`) so the framework collects management and downstream
state into `_artifacts/` automatically.

```bash
export RANCHER_HOSTNAME=<host-lan-ip>.sslip.io
export HARVESTER_KUBECONFIG_B64=$(base64 -w0 < harvester.kubeconfig)
make test-import-gitops
```
